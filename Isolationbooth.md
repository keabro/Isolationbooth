Our project is an isolation booth to determine when a wireless device is within a certain area. It accomplishes this task by the use of directional antennas hooked up to a few USB wireless chipsets and a ground plane. The booth takes the devices MAC address and binds it to a photograph of its owner. The process for this will be to create an app on the mobile device that when originally open asks for the user to take a photo of themselves. That photo is then stored for later use. Whenever a user is determined to be within the isolation booth the MAC address that has been obtained is given to the server and the server over the network determines what the IP address of the device is and sends a request for the photo. The mobile device opens a connection and sends the photo, which the server then takes and binds to its MAC address so whenever that mobile device appears on the network we have a photo of the user for various statistical analyses. One planned use for this is in tandem with a setup that determines a devices location to some degree of accuracy in order to determine what other devices it is near. That data would be run through an algorithm to make a spreadsheet of which devices are “friends” or spend the most time near each other. The isolation booth would add pictures to this spreadsheet to put names to faces so to speak.
